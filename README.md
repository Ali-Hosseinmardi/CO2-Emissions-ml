# Predicting COâ‚‚ Emissions with Machine Learning

This project uses regression and clustering techniques in R to predict COâ‚‚ emissions based on historical data from 1975â€“2021.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- Data cleaning and z-score normalization
- Regression models: SVR, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree
- Unsupervised learning: K-Means clustering
- Model evaluation (RMSE & RÂ²)
- Feature importance visualization
- Ethical discussion and future work

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Machine Learning Paper.pdf`: Final research paper
- `co2_emissions_analysis.R`: R code (end-to-end)
- `co2_emissions_data.csv`: Sample cleaned data

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Visuals
- Feature importance (Random Forest)
- Emission distribution (histogram)
- Trend over time (line plot)
- Clustering output
